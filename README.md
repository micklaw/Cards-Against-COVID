# Cards Against COVID
I hate COVID-19, keeping us all couped up inside, but you know what I do love, Cards Against Humanity, and Blazor, and Azure Functions. So all of that combined with some free time and free zure credits has produced this monstrosity.

This game should contain about 7k black prompt cards and about 24k White response cards, so I think that is just about every card ever made.

**NOTE: As per CAH's T&Cs, I am not making anything off this and anyone who wants it can have it**

## Why?
Why the fuck not?

## How do I play
These rules may be lightly adapted for me and my friend, as it was built for us and not you, so STFU.
